<h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

<h2>Those I Teach</h2>

<p>
Over many years as a player and teacher of the clarinet and of music, I have developed a class of students which has embraced those who are (or are about to be) very accomplished professional players, other students who are gifted semi-professional players, and also some students whose varied involvements and backgrounds would probably best define them as dedicated avocational players of virtually all ages.
</p>

<p>
Irrespective of a particular student's level of accomplishment at a given moment, the common principle that distinguishes them and makes them my students is that <strong>they all care to know what makes it real</strong>. They want to discover for themselves what is genuine; what the craft is and what first-class i. They know that&mdash;somewhere out there within the deep blue sea of acoustics, physical finesse, artistic instinct&mdash;there exists real clarinet playing and real musical art to know about, and that they would like to have as much of that as possible available to them in their own lives. Getting people moving in that direction is what my teaching is all about.
</p>

<h2>How I Teach</h2>

<p>
I meet every stuent exactly where they are at this moment.
</p>

<p>
But I <strong>never</strong> condescend. In other words, I never assume that certain students are in some way limited or need to be taught in some limited way.
</p>

<p>
On the contrary&mdash;Igrant that <strong>every</strong> student is deserving and able to receive everything I have to give them from the cleanest and highest perspective possible, to do with what they can.
</p>

<p>
This was worked really quite nicely.
</p>

<p>
Any interested person to whom this prospect seems compelling is most welcome to inquire.
