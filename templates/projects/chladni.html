Another interactive curve visualizer, this time inspired by Meara O'Reilly's <a href="http://mearaoreilly.com/index.php?/project/for-bjoerks-biophilia/">collaboration</a> with Bj&ouml;rk for the latter's Biophilia Tour. Chladni curves shows how waves propagate across a flat, finite surface. Each point's acceleration is inversely proportional to the relative position of its neighbors, so higher points get pulled down and vice versa. Waves reflect against the edges of the surface, and the constructive and destructive interference creates beautiful patterns. I made this with <a href="http://tytel.org/">Matt Tytel</a>.
